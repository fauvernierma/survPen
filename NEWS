survPen v1.5.0
==============

Changes:
* Gradient and Hessian of LCV and LAML are coded in compiled C code. The associated code has also been reorganized
* colSums and cor.var are also rewritten in C
* hazard ratios and associated CIs added to predict method
* edf1 is taken as an upper bound for edf2 (as in mgcv)


survPen v1.3.0
==============

Changes:
* added functions '%mult%' and '%vec%' for matrix multiplication in compiled C code 
in order to substantially reduce computation time

Debugging:
* beta.ini is now correctly reparameterized before fitting
* the class of matrices are now tested using 'inherits' instead of 'class(object)=='


survPen v1.2.0
==============

Changes:
* the computation burden has been reduced by only calculating the diagonal
elements of the fourth derivatives of the likelihood (without precision loss)
* if the LU decompistion fails to invert the penlaty matrix, A QR decomposition is tried. 
If the QR fails, a Cholesky decomposition is tried
* corrected knots management when they are in a list format (takes into account the names of the list instead of the order of appearance)
* all crossproducts are now evaluated by the crossprod function
* the penalized log-likelihood at convergence was renamed ll.pen (instead of ll)


survPen v1.1.0 
==============

Changes:

* includes a vignette called Survival_analysis_with_survPen that shows detailed examples of the package functionalities
* examples 5 and 6 from the help page were deleted as they were clumsy. More detailed examples are available in the vignette Survival_analysis_with_survPen 
* returns a convergence indicator (converged = TRUE or FALSE)
* when using a factor by variable, same.rho=FALSE is used as default instead of same.rho=TRUE
* function crs returns knots when intercept=FALSE
